# Sombric2019Perception
The included code and the data available on OSF (https://osf.io/fex8t/) can be used to replicate the finding of Sombric et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52860-9).

"NormalizedStudyData" contains files where step lengths have all been normalized by speeed specific baseline and then 1 is subtracted such that positive values indicate longer step lengths than baseline and negative values indicated shorter step lengths than baseline.

The parameters in the paper called slow and fast step length are called 'stepLengthSlow' and 'stepLengthFast', respectively, in the code.

The parameter called step length asymmetry in the paper is called 'netContributionNorm2'.

Epochs in the paper called 'Perceptual After-Effects', 'Motor After-Effects', 'Late Perception', and 'Early Post-Adaptation' are called 'NormBFAfter1', 'Catch', 'NormECm', and 'EarlyWash' in the code, respectively.
